**The Jupyter Notebook contains:**
1. STATE WISE COMMODITIES LIST
2. BAR PLOT OF TOTAL NO OF EACH COMMODITIES PRODUCED BY EACH STATE
3. BAR PLOT OF TOP 10 STATES BY NO. OF DIFFERENT COMMODITIES FOUND
4. BAR PLOT SHOWING TOTAL NO. OF OCCURENCE OF EACH COMMODITY IN INDIA 
5. PLOTS SHOWING TOTAL NO. OF EACH COMMODITIES PRODUCED BY EACH STATE
6. AN INTERACTIVE MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF OCCURENNCE OF EACH COMMODITY
7. AN INTERACTIVE BUUBLE MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF OCCURENNCE OF EACH COMMODITY SEGRAGATED BY METAL, NON_METAL AND BASE_METAL

**NOTE:**
1. The main dataset(1) may contain `Missing State Name` or `Outdated State Name` or both.(Like in case of data related to India). It can be solved by `Geoencoding` for reverse lookup of State Name by using `Lattitude` and `Longitude` values. 
2. Here `TOTAL NO OF COMMODITY` indicates total no of its occurence in each State or in India.
